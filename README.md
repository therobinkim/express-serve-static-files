## General Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/therobinkim/express-serve-static-files.git`
2. `cd express-server-static-files`
3. `cd confusing` or `cd better`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm start`
6. Open http://localhost:8080/public.html and http://localhost:8080/static.html; if the text appears in two different colors, then all of the static assets are being loaded correctly. (You can also open your DevTools to check for the JavaScript `console.log` statements.)
